# nanoleafLamp

This project contains the software to a DIY-lamp, which imitates the "nanoleaf" Hexagon Lamps.
The lamp was built using a WS2812B LED-strip which is controlled by an ESP8266-microcontroller.
You can control the light-animations via WiFi with any Amazon-Alexa device or, if you want a mobile interface, the app "Blynk".

Features like music-reactive light effects using Fast Fourier Transformation may be added in the future.
